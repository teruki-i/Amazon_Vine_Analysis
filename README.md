# Amazon Vine Program Review Bias Analysis
## Overview
This analysis sought to determine whether or not there is a bias in reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. For this analysis, I used data on US-based reviews on watches. I filtered the data to create a table showing data on product reviews. I further filtered for reviews with at least 20 votes and were voted as helpful at least 50% of the time. This narrowed the data from 960,872 reviews to 8,409 reviews. From there, I analyzed the bias.

## Results
The 8,409 reviews included the following:
1. Vine Program participants
    - 47 reviews
    - 15 5-star ratings
    - 31.91% of reviews gave 5-star ratings
2. Non program participants
    - 8,362 reviews
    - 4,332 5-star ratings
    - 51.81% of reviews gave 5-star ratings 

These results suggest that Vine program participants are much more likely to give negative reviews. However, there were very few program participants in this filtered data set. With such a small sample size, it's hard to tell if the bias analysis for the program participants is accurate. Additional data would be necessary to get a better sense of review bias or the analysis should also include reviews below 5-star. Alternatively, this analysis could be performed on a different type of product that has more reviews and therefore more program participants.
