# Amazon Vine Program Review Bias Analysis
## Overview
This analysis sought to determine whether or not there is a bias in reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. For this analysis, I used US-based data on US-based reviews on watches. I filtered that data to create a table showing data on product reviews. I further filtered that data for products with at least 20 reviews and were voted as helpful at least 50% of the time. This narrowed the data from 960,872 reviews to 8,409 reviews. From there, I analyzed the bias.

## Results
Of the 8,409 reviews in the filtered data, 47 reviews were by users in the Vine program. Of those 47, only 15 (or approximately 31.91%) gave 5-star reviews to the watches. However, of the 8,362 reviewers that weren't part of the Vine Program, 4,332 (or approximately 51.81%) gave 5-star reviews.

These results suggest that Vine Program participants are much more likely to give negative reviews. However, there were very few program participants in this filtered data set. With such a small sample size, it's hard to tell if the bias analysis for the program participants is accurate. Additional data would be necessary to get a better sense of review bias.
